## Installation Guide üõ†Ô∏è

Okay, so here's how to get this awesome extension up and running on your browser. Listen up!

### For Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers like Edge)

1.  **Download the Extension Files:**
    -   Click on the "Code" button on this GitHub repository. This will take you to the main page where the repository's files are located.
    -   Select "Download ZIP". A ZIP archive containing all the necessary extension files will be downloaded to your computer. The exact location of the downloaded file depends on your browser's settings (usually the "Downloads" folder).
    -   Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer. üìÅ Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file and choose "Extract All..." and follow the prompts to extract the contents to a new folder. Choose a location you'll remember, like your Desktop or Documents folder.
2.  **Enable Developer Mode in Chrome:**
    -   Open Google Chrome (or your Chromium-based browser like Edge).
    -   Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your address bar. Type this address directly into the address bar at the top of the browser window and press Enter. This will open Chrome's extensions management page.
    -   Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner. ‚û°Ô∏è On the extensions management page, you'll see a switch labeled "Developer mode." Click this switch to turn it on. This allows you to install unpacked extensions.
3.  **Load the Unpacked Extension:**
    -   Click the "Load unpacked" button. This button will appear at the top left of the extensions management page after you've enabled Developer Mode.
    -   Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files. A file dialog will open. Browse to the location where you extracted the contents of the ZIP file in step 1.
    -   Select the folder. üìÇ Select the \*folder itself\*, not any of the files inside it. Chrome needs the folder containing the extension's files.
4.  **Pin the Extension (Optional but Recommended):**
    -   Click the puzzle icon in the Chrome toolbar. üß© This icon, also known as the extensions icon, is usually located to the right of the address bar. It displays a list of your installed extensions.
    -   Find "YouTube Shorts Auto Scroller" in the list. Scroll through the list of extensions to find the one you just installed.
    -   Click the pin icon to keep it visible for easy access. üìå Clicking the pin icon next to the extension's name will add its icon to the Chrome toolbar, making it easy to toggle the extension on or off.

### Using the Extension

Once installed, the extension adds a button to the bottom right of the YouTube Shorts page. As shown in the image, this button will be rounded and has an arrow down on it.

-   **To start auto-scrolling:** Click the button. The button icon will change to indicate that auto-scrolling is active. You should then see the Shorts automatically advance to the next one after the current one finishes playing.
-   **To stop auto-scrolling:** Click the button again. The icon will revert to its original state, and the Shorts will no longer automatically advance. You'll have to manually scroll as you normally would.

Enjoy your hands-free Shorts watching! üéâ
